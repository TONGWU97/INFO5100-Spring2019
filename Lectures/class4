Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism to reuse functionality between classes
A class can inherit from another class using extends keyword
Child class inherits data and behavior from the base class
Java only supports multi level inheritance (with only parent for every class)
Only public, protected and default scoped data or behaviors can be inherited into child classes
A method in the base class can be overriden in the child class (Use @override annotation for overridden behaviors)
Constructor from the base class will be invoked in the child class before invoking the child class constructor
